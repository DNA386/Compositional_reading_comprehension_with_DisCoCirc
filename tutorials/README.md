# Compositional reading comprehension with DisCoCirc: tutorials

The notebooks and code included here is intended as a quickstart for replicating the results obtained in the thesis,
using the `lambeq` package as a backend.

The `following` task is split into two notebooks: one for data generation and training, 
and the other for interpreting and visualising the model.

The `bAbI 6` notebooks are structured similarly, with a data generation and training notebook,
as well as a compositional interpretability notebook. 
Note that the data generation for the bAbI 6 task in the thesis was done using a modification of the `dyna-babi` package,
which can be found [here](https://github.com/ronentk/dyna-babi-kit), [(Tamari et. al, 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00086).

Adapting the notebook used is currently in progress, as is the inclusion of the neural network architecture for DisCoCirc.
