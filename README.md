# Compositional reading comprehension with DisCoCirc

This repository is included as a companion to the thesis 'A Compositional Approach to Reading Comprehension Tasks Using
the DisCoCirc Natural Language Processing Framework.' by Tiffany Duneau.

It is in two parts: 
- the app section includes a showcase application that can be run to interact with the trained models 
for the `following` dataset.
- the tutorial section contains notebooks for running equivalent experiments to those recorded in the thesis, 
adapted to use `lambeq`.

The `lambeq` package is continuously being updated and enhanced with new features; the interested reader is hence
pointed to their documentation to find the latest tutorials:
